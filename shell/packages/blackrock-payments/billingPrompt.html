<template name="billingPrompt">
  {{!--
    Prompts the user to choose a plan, and a credit card with which to pay for it. Once the user
    has chosen something, their quota is updated.

    Data inputs:
    - reason:
        "voluntary": The user clicked a "sign up" button or is upgrading a plan. Optionally,
          `previousPlan` is also passed in.
        "outOfStorage": User ran out of storage.
        "outOfCompute": User ran out of compute units.
        "outOfGrains": Demo mode may limit the number of grains created.
        "customApp": User wants to install a custom app.
    - onComplete: Function to call on completion. The parameter is a boolean: true if the user
        successfully chose a new plan (in which case the action prompting billing should continue)
        or false if they dismissed the popup without choosing anything (in which case the action
        should be canceled).

    This will be included at the top level HTML like:

      {{#if billingPromptReason}}
        {{>billingPrompt reason=billingPromptReason onComplete=onBillingPromptDone
                         topbar=globalTopbar db=globalDb accountsUi=globalAccountsUi}}
      {{/if}}

    (In this example, `billingPromptReason` is probably some session variable.)

        Oops! You're all out of compute units. Your current account level gives you
        {{renderCu myPlan.compute}} compute units per month. They recharge continuously, so you
        can either wait a while and try again, or you can upgrade to a larger plan:
